# Urban Earth Observation & Spatial Risk Analytics

## What this portfolio demonstrates
- Designing Earth observation analytics backwards from planning and risk decisions
- Translating satellite data into governance-aligned, decision-ready evidence
- Making explicit trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and interpretability under constraint

## The problems addressed
### Unplanned urban growth
Detecting where and when rapid urban expansion creates planning, infrastructure, and service-delivery risk.

### Flood risk under operational constraints
Producing defensible flood susceptibility and impact insights within realistic emergency-response timelines within public-sector response and reporting workflows.

## Why Earth observation is appropriate
- Consistent spatial coverage across jurisdictions
- Timely monitoring where ground data is incomplete or delayed
- Scalable evidence base where statutory or ground-based data is incomplete, delayed, or uneven

## How to read these projects
- Start with executive summaries
- Focus on decision context before methods
- Treat maps as evidence, not conclusions
- Read limitations sections as carefully as results sections

## What this portfolio does not attempt
- It does not replace statutory planning or hydrological models
- It does not claim predictive certainty
- It prioritises decision support over academic novelty
