# Rapid Flood Susceptibility & Impact Mapping

## Executive summary
This project demonstrates how decision-ready flood susceptibility and impact insights can be produced within a 48–72 hour operational window using open Earth observation data.

## Operational context
- Emergency-response timelines
- Data latency and uncertainty
- Need for interpretable outputs

## Defining “rapid” analysis
Rapid means early enough to influence decisions, not instant.  
The focus is on credibility and clarity within realistic response windows.

## Method selection under time pressure
- Weighted overlay as primary method
- Machine learning as secondary comparator
- Explicit trade-offs between speed and accuracy

## Outputs produced within 72 hours
- Flood susceptibility tiers
- Impact overlays
- Summary tables for prioritisation

## What improves with more time
- Additional validation
- Model refinement
- Accuracy gains

## Limitations
- Data availability
- Method simplifications
- Interpretation risks

## Relationship to urban growth risk
Urban growth patterns from Project 1 help contextualise flood exposure and vulnerability.
